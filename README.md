In this project, I analyzed a comprehensive dataset of electric vehicles, providing valuable insights into the industry. Hereâ€™s what the dashboard covers:

ðŸ”¹ Total Vehicle Count: Displays the total number of electric vehicles, differentiating between BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles) and PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles).

ðŸ”¹ Average Range of Electric Vehicles: Shows the average range of electric vehicles in miles, with a comparison between BEV and PHEV ranges.

ðŸ”¹ Vehicle Type Distribution: Presents the percentage of BEV and PHEV vehicles from the total count, visualized using pie charts and bar graphs.

ðŸ”¹ Analysis by Model Year: Displays the total number of electric vehicles for each model year, highlighting trends and growth over time.

ðŸ”¹ Analysis by State: Breaks down the total number of electric vehicles by state, identifying regions with the highest and lowest adoption rates.

ðŸ”¹ Analysis by Make: Shows the total number of electric vehicles by manufacturer, spotlighting leading companies in the market.

ðŸ”¹ CAFV Eligibility: Analyzes the number of electric vehicles eligible for Clean Air Vehicle (CAFV) incentives, providing insights into the impact of these incentives on adoption rates.

ðŸ”¹ Analysis by Vehicle Model: Displays the total number of electric vehicles by specific model, identifying popular models and trends in consumer preferences.
