# Electric_Vehicle_Data_Analysis_Project
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of electric vehicles, covering total vehicle count (BEV vs. PHEV), average range, vehicle type distribution, model year trends, state-wise adoption, manufacturer breakdown, CAFV eligibility, and popular models. This comprehensive dashboard provides insights into industry trends and consumer preferences.
